				<p align="justify">OUR-LIBRARY, is a co-educational
					day-cum-boarding LIBRARY, with approximately 9,500 coustemer on its
					rolls. These children, in the Junior and Senior branches, study in
					the three different campusesTo build Open Library, we need hundreds 
					of millions of book records, a wiki interface, and lots of people who
					 are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site..</p>
				<p align="justify">The LIBRARY considers education to be a
					life-long process which should have a strong foundation. The goal
					of the LIBRARY is to inculcate in the coustemer a love for learning
					and a desire to excel at every level. The LIBRARY also aims at
					equipping the coustemer with the intellectual and practical skills
					that are necessary to meet the challenges in the future.</p>
				<p align="justify">To sum up, the mission of OUR-LIBRARY, c.p.
					&quot;to open doors and open minds&quot; and prepare the ground for
					the future of the nation.</p>
				<p align="justify" class="bodytextheading">Our Culture</p>
				<p align="justify">To date, we have gathered over 20 million records
				 from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions,
				  with more on the way.</p>
				<p align="justify">The values, which are ingrained help to
					promote confidence, direction, and critical thinking skills,
					leading to the development of well-adjusted, adaptable and
					integrated personalities. In other words, OUR-LIBRARY offers
					comprehensive and holistic education.</p>

				<p align="justify">Open Library is an open project: the software is
				 open, the data are open, the documentation is open, and we welcome
				  your contribution. Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a
				   widget--it's all welcome. We have a small team of fantastic
				    programmers who have accomplished a lot, but we can't do it alone!</p>
				<p align="justify">These qualities have placed OUR-LIBRARY, c.p.
					on the forefront. There has been a continuity of purpose,
					underlying the change and growth of the LIBRARY. Over the years,
					OUR-LIBRARY has steadily reflected a spirit of innovation in
					response to need, and has broadened its educational mission, by
					creating an academic environment that fosters close association and
					the exchange of ideas with some of the top LIBRARYs in the nation
					and the world.</p>

				 Archive, and has been funded in part by a grant from the California 
				 State Library and the Kahle/Austin Foundation..</p>
